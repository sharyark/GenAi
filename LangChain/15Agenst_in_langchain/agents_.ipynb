Israel stunned Iran last week with an intelligence and military operation years in the making that struck high-level targets with precision. President Donald Trump said overnight Tuesday he's seeking \"a real end\" to the conflict between Israel and Iran, arguing that outcome would be preferable to a ceasefire while also suggesting his patience for negotiations was wearing thin. Israel said Tuesday that they killed Iran's wartime chief of staff Maj. Gen. Ali Shamdani, a close ally of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Aerial attacks between Israel and Iran continued overnight into Tuesday, marking a fifth day of strikes following Israel's Friday attack. That surprise operation hit at the heart of Iran's nuclear program, striking key facilities and killing several nuclear scientists as well as high-ranking military leaders, according to Israeli officials.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe latest news indicates a recent escalation of conflict between Iran and Israel, including aerial attacks and intelligence operations.
